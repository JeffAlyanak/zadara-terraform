# Docker Swarm with Portainer Portal Example
This script deploy 1 docker swarm manager and a variable amount of worker nodes.
For the Network, Security Group and Server we use Terraform.
After all server are created and the elastic ip are assigned, terraform start a Ansible playbook that install docker with all dependencies, install swarm, create the cluster and add all worker vmâ€™s to the cluster.
After docker and swarm is ready, Ansible install the portainer management portal as a docker container.
